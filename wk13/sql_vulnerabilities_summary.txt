1. Ben
The query can not find any result as expected because the value of active column is 0
2. Ben'-- 
The query returns result of firstname: Ben and active: 0 as expected
Because '--' means ignore everything after that, so it didnt check for the active value
3. Ben' or 1=1
The query cannot find any result not as I expected.
I expected it will display all the records which either have firstname is Ben or have active = 1

Mitigate SQL Injection: 
All three cases have results as I have expected.
